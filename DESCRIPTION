Title: Time Varying Mediation Analysis
Description: A set of functions to measure the effect of mediating variables over time. This method takes
  into consideration the dynamic effect that a mediator may have over time; thus the realistic nature of an
  effect over time is characterized as opposed to the traditional approach of estimating an effect based on
  its single occurrence.
