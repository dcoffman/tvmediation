\title{Function to compute new Mediator and Outcome using time t and t-1 mean centered on the individual}
\usage{
newMediatorOutcome(trt, M, Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{trt}{numeric binary treatment group indicator for each individual}

\item{M}{(t.seq x N) matrix where N = number of observations. 
Column 1 is mediator at time t-1. Column 2 is mediator at time t.}

\item{Y}{(Nx1) matrix were N = number of observations. Column 1 is outcome at time t-1.}
}
\value{
\item{newMO}{list containing new mediators, outcomes, and index of complete cases}
}
\description{
Part of the set of internal functions called within the \code{tvma} function to assist in the estimation of time varying mediation effect.
